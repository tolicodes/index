# Speaking at Conferences

## Todo

- identify technical meetups/conferences we can attend and speak at
- identify potential speakers inside of HOVER (I have a list of topics ready to go)
- collectively coach and prepare speakers for talks. Maybe a workshop where we put together a few talks and practice them in front of small internal audiences
