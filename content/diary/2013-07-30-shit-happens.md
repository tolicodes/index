# Shit Happens, Someone Didn't Necessarily Screw Up

We only hire from the neck down.
We shouldn't assume that somebody screwed up. Usually nobody screwed up, we usually do our best to so something. But we don't see the long term consequences of our best efforts.

When a system fails us I would need to analyze why. We need to step back and analyze what happened and how we can prevent. Proactive vs reactive.
