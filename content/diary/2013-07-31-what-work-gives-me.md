# What Work Gives Me

I've given a lot of thoughts and second guesses on the amount of time I spend at work. It is true that I sacrifice freedom: I can't really live my life to its fullest right now, pursue meaningful relationships, but it's ok as long as I have a plan.

I work for 3 reasons

• experience
• reputation
• vision of a company

Working at a job isn't just for money. It's to build your skills, reputation, and ability to work towards a common goal with others. I'm also lucky enough to be working on a goal I believe in, a vision which I share with the Company. Knowing that I'm making the world a slightly better place helps me when I feel like giving up or start second guessing my decisions in life.

I tried doing Startups when in college, and failed because I was lacking in those qualities. My ideas were great! But I didn't have what it took to carry them out.

When I feel ready I will try again to create a startup, which if successful will give me those 3 dimensions they talk about (money, time, freedom) as well as a 4th dimension I feel trumps those others: purpose/vision.
