## Love is a fire

Love is a fire
Warm, soft, gently caressing
Love it a light
Giving life, nurturing growth

Love if a flame
Stirring, mixing, evolving, changing
Love is a blaze,
Inspiring, coming alive, birthing

But let that love lose control,
And it turns into a brutal inferno
Destroying everything in itâ€™s path
Devouring and leveling indiscriminately
Scorching and maiming the ones that controlled it

How tempting love is,
Beckoning to overtake you,
Burn hotter and brighter
Tempting one to surrender

Once one is lost in its magnetic trance
Explode, enveloping all
Taking away everything it once gave
Returning it back into the all

Man had mastered fire
It danced harmlessly in our candles
Captured beautifully in our chandeliers
Bringing forth technology of dreams and magic

Fire brought safety and joy
Taking away the toils in the fields
The isolation of the cold
The fear of the dark alone

But as fire took over
It brought back that same fear
That same deadening isolation
Compelling us to toil and struggle yet again

Thus forever man and fire
Dance their perpetual dance
The push and the pull
Giving and taking away
